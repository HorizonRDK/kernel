What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/epn
Description:
		This attribute reports the configured Elliptic Project Number
		of the engine, in hexadeicmal.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/stepping
Description:
		This attribute indicates the reported H/W revision of this
		design, in decimal.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/mode
Description:
		This attribute reports whether the engine is currently in
		secure or promiscuous mode.  The mode can be changed by
		writing either the string "secure" or "promiscuous".

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/seed
Description:
		In promiscuous mode, this attribute can be read to report
		the internal random seed (as a sequence of hexadecimal digits)
		currently being used by the engine.  It is not readable in
		secure mode.  Writes of either exactly 32 bytes (binary input)
		or 64 hexadecimal digits (text input) to this attribute will
		stage a seed value for a subsequent nonce reseed operation.

What:		/sys/devices/platfrom/clp800/reseed_action
Description:
		Writing "random" or "nonce" to this attribute will trigger a
		random reseed or nonce reseed, respectively.  Writes will
		block until the requested operation completes fully. Nonce
		reseeds require that a seed value be previously written to the
		seed attribute.  Reading this attribute reports the source of
		the current seed.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/reject_threshold
Description:
		Configures the rejection threshold of the internal bit
		generators, which is used to tweak the ring lengths.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/seed_generation
Description:
		A counter which increments whenever the driver detects that
		the engine has been reseeded.  Note that if two or more random
		reseeds occur in rapid succession, the driver may not detect
		these as separate reseed events.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/random
Description:
		Reads a single output value from the engine as a sequence
		of hexadecimal digits.  Note that the size of the output is
		variable.  For retrieving large amounts of random data from
		the engine, it is much faster to use the standard Linux hwrng
		interface rather than this attribute.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/output_len
Description:
		Configures the output size of the engine, in bytes.  This can
		set to either 16 (128-bit) or 32 (256-bit), but 256-bit mode
		is not supported in all hardware configurations.  Except for
		testing, there is little reason to set this to anything other
		than the default (maximum) value.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/wd_requests
Description:
		Configures the request-based reseed reminder.  A request alarm
		will be signaled after the specified number of random numbers
		have been generated on a single seed.  Note that changes to
		this setting do not take effect until the next reseed.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/clp800/wd_cycles
Description:
		Configures the age-based reseed reminder.  An age alarm will
		be signaled after a single seed has been in use for the
		specified number of cycles.  Note that changes to this
		setting do not take effect until the next reseed.

What:		/sys/bus/platform/clp800/wd_alarm
Description:
		Reports the most recent alarm to have triggered, or "none" if
		there is no alarm.
